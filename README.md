# OC Health Inspector

I wanted to play with [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) as well as ERB, outside of Rails, and this is where I ended up.

This app scrapes the [Orange County Health Care Agency](https://orangeeco.envisionconnect.com/#/pa2/search) database for restaurants that have been shut down by the health inspectors. It stores this data in a local database and generates some very basic output to an HTML page.
